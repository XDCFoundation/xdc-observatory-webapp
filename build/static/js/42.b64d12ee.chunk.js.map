Accordingly, you may not rely on this Website for any\r\n              particular purpose but should instead consult qualified\r\n              professional advisors prior to making any decision which could\r\n              affect your legal, business, investment, or technical interests.\r\n            </Para>\r\n            <PointHeading>Risks related to use of XDC coins</PointHeading>\r\n            <Para>\r\n              XDC coins, powered by XDC Network’s XDPoS consensus protocol, are\r\n              private instruments, are not registered with any regulatory agency\r\n              of any jurisdiction, and are not subject to the same regulatory\r\n              requirements as exchange traded funds or mutual funds which would\r\n              be registered with appropriate regulatory authorities (e.g., the\r\n              Monetary Authority of Singapore or the Securities and Exchange\r\n              Commission in the United States). This is likely true of all\r\n              tokens associated with Third-Party dApps as well. Because XDC\r\n              coins are not registered instruments, any information on the\r\n              Website or elsewhere purporting to relate to pricing and valuation\r\n              may lack the standardization and reliability typical of investment\r\n              instruments.

Any investor can\r\n              lose all or a considerable portion of his or her investment, but\r\n              this is particularly true with an investment that is unregulated.\r\n              The value of unregulated assets can drop to zero in less time than\r\n              it takes to read these Terms of Use. Anyone planning to invest\r\n              must have appropriate sophistication, experience, financial\r\n              ability, and willingness to bear risks of an investment. No\r\n              investment in XDC coins should be made in an amount greater than\r\n              the maximum loss you are willing and able to bear.\r\n            </Para>\r\n            <Para>\r\n              Fees and expenses associated with transfer of XDC coins (which may\r\n              be considerable, regardless of any other factors) will offset any\r\n              trading profits that might be realized through the purchase, sale,\r\n              and exchange of XDC coins.\r\n            </Para>\r\n            <Para>\r\n              In making statements on the Website, the site owner may rely on\r\n              trading expertise and experience of third-party advisors, the\r\n              identity of which may not be disclosed to the public, or may make\r\n              such statements without any reliance on any expert, evidence, or\r\n              authority whatsoever.

Any investment in XDC\r\n              can lead to loss of money over short or long periods.\r\n              “Cryptocurrency” trading is not appropriate for all users of the\r\n              Website and may not be appropriate for you. Anyone who is planning\r\n              to invest in cryptocurrencies should consult a well-qualified,\r\n              independent, and professional financial advisor. The information\r\n              published on the Website is not a suitable replacement for such an\r\n              advisor and cannot guarantee that a purchaser of XDC will not lose\r\n              money.{\" \"}\r\n            </Para>\r\n            <PointHeading>No Investment Advice </PointHeading>\r\n            <Para>\r\n              The entire body of information given on the Website does not\r\n              consist of or include investment advice, trading advice, financial\r\n              advice, technical advice, or any other kind of advice.
