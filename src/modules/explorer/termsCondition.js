              This Website is a tool. As with every other tool built my
              humanity, this Website is well suited for very few applications
              and poorly suited for all others. Mastery of any craft or subject
              matter necessarily lies in the master, not in the tools he or she
              employs. Accordingly, you may not rely on this Website for any
              particular purpose but should instead consult qualified
              professional advisors prior to making any decision which could
              affect your legal, business, investment, or technical interests.
            </Para>
            <PointHeading>Risks related to use of XDC coins</PointHeading>
            <Para>
              XDC coins, powered by XDC Network’s XDPoS consensus protocol, are
              private instruments, are not registered with any regulatory agency
              of any jurisdiction, and are not subject to the same regulatory
              requirements as exchange traded funds or mutual funds which would
              be registered with appropriate regulatory authorities (e.g., the
              Monetary Authority of Singapore or the Securities and Exchange
              Commission in the United States). This is likely true of all
              tokens associated with Third-Party dApps as well. Because XDC
              coins are not registered instruments, any information on the
              Website or elsewhere purporting to relate to pricing and valuation
              may lack the standardization and reliability typical of investment
              instruments. XDC coins have not been reviewed or approved by
              federal, state or local regulators of any jurisdiction.
            </Para>
            <Para>You should carefully note the following:</Para>
            <Para>
              To the extent any person would purchase or receive XDC coins for
              investment purposes, such investment is purely speculative
              investment and involves a high degree of risk. Any investor can
              lose all or a considerable portion of his or her investment, but
              this is particularly true with an investment that is unregulated.
              The value of unregulated assets can drop to zero in less time than
              it takes to read these Terms of Use. Anyone planning to invest
              must have appropriate sophistication, experience, financial
              ability, and willingness to bear risks of an investment. No
              investment in XDC coins should be made in an amount greater than
              the maximum loss you are willing and able to bear.
            </Para>
            <Para>
              Fees and expenses associated with transfer of XDC coins (which may
              be considerable, regardless of any other factors) will offset any
              trading profits that might be realized through the purchase, sale,
              and exchange of XDC coins.
            </Para>

              In making statements on the Website, the site owner may rely on
              trading expertise and experience of third-party advisors, the

              such statements without any reliance on any expert, evidence, or

              order to make a knowing and informed investment, may be available
              on other websites or from other sources; such sources ought to be
              carefully reviewed prior to purchasing, trading, exchanging,
              staking, or selling XDC coins or otherwise incurring any risk
              associated therewith.

            <PointHeading>Investment Risks </PointHeading>
            <Para>
              The price of XDC coins is highly volatile and you should expect
              prices to have wide-ranging fluctuations. Any investment in XDC
              can lead to loss of money over short or long periods.

              published on the Website is not a suitable replacement for such an
